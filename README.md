Blockchain Freelance Contract Project
This project is a blockchain-based freelance contract platform that allows secure contract creation, management, and validation using Ethereum smart contracts. It includes a Streamlit-based frontend, a smart contract written in Solidity, and a Python backend to handle blockchain interactions.
